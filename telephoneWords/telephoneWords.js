/*
Each number key on a standard phone keypad has a set of Latin letters written on it as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Telephone-keypad2.svg

Businesses often try to come up with clever ways to spell out their phone number in advertisements to make it more memorable. But there are a lot of combinations!

Write a function that takes up to four digits of a phone number, and returns a list of all of the words (in alphabetical order) that can be written on the phone with that number (you should return all permutations, not only English words).


telephoneWords("0002") // [ "000A", "000B", "000C" ]
telephoneWords("1123") // [ "11AD", "11AE", "11AF", "11BD", "11BE", "11BF", "11CD", "11CE", "11CF" ]
*/

const telephoneNumbers = {
  0: ["0"],
  1: ["1"],
  2: ["A", "B", "C"],
  3: ["D", "E", "F"],
  4: ["G", "H", "I"],
  5: ["J", "K", "L"],
  6: ["M", "N", "O"],
  7: ["P", "Q", "R", "S"],
  8: ["T", "U", "V"],
  9: ["W", "X", "Y", "Z"]
};

function telephoneWords(digitString) {
  // your code here...
  var list = [];
  digitString.forEach(digit => {
    list.push(telephoneNumbers[digit]);
  });
  return list;
}
